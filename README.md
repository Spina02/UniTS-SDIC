# UniTS-SDIC

Welcome to my repository for the **Scientific and Data Intensive Computing (SDIC)** Master's degree at UniTS. Here, I store and organize all my academic resources, including:

- Lecture slides
- PDFs
- Digital versions of reference books

I currently take notes in [Notion](https://el-spina.notion.site/10ccd3688f4f80b480f0dcde932649a9?v=1687c29bf38340668fec0135f9f0a3cd), but I plan to migrate to **LaTeX** for note-taking in future semesters. 

Feel free to explore the repository to find helpful resources and follow my learning journey in SDIC!

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `Slides/`: Lecture presentations and course materials
- `Books/`: Digital versions of textbooks and reference materials
- `Notes/`: Personal notes and summaries (currently in Notion, later in LaTeX)
- `Assignments/`: Homework, projects, and coding exercises

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal use, but if you find something useful or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request
